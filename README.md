# Sean's Theme
## A Modular Discord Theme
### This is a Discord Theme Primarily for Vencord/Vesktop though it has a lot of compatibility with BetterDiscord
### Features:
#### - Catppuccin Colors 
#### - Built-In Radial Status and Settings Modal
#### - Minimalist Design
#### - Lots of Options
#### - Custom Fonts
## WARNING!
#### - This Theme Removes a lot of buttons, disable the "Hiding Misceleanous Stuff" section to have everything shown
#### - This was tested on an old PC so I can't vouch for performance
